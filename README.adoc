Spring Boot command line features for
https://github.com/spring-cloud[Spring Cloud].


== Installation

To install, make
sure you have
https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot[Spring Boot CLI]
(1.1.x with x>=5):

    $ spring version
    Spring CLI v1.1.8.RELEASE

e.g. for GVM users

```
$ gvm install springboot 1.1.8.RELEASE
$ gvm use springboot 1.1.8.RELEASE
```

then get the install command plugin (backported from Boot 1.2.0):

```
$ wget http://dl.bintray.com/dsyer/generic/install-0.0.2.jar
```

install it in the Spring Boot CLI

e.g. for GVM users:

```
$ cp install-0.0.2.jar ~/.gvm/springboot/1.1.8.RELEASE/lib
```

e.g. for Homebrew users:

```
$ cp install-0.0.2.jar `brew --prefix springboot`/lib
```

and finally install the Spring Cloud plugin:

```
$ mvn install
$ spring install org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-cli:1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT
```

== Building

== Basic Compile and Test

To build the source you will need to install
http://maven.apache.org/run-maven/index.html[Apache Maven] v3.0.6 or above and JDK 1.7.

Spring Cloud uses Maven for most build-related activities, and you
should be able to get off the ground quite quickly by cloning the
project you are interested in and typing

----
$ mvn install -s .settings.xml
----

NOTE: You may need to increase the amount of memory available to Maven by setting
a `MAVEN_OPTS` environment variable with the value `-Xmx512m -XX:MaxPermSize=128m`

The `.settings.xml` is only required the first time (or after updates
to dependencies). It is there to provide repository declarations so
that those do not need to be hard coded in the project poms.

For hints on how to build the project look in `.travis.yml` if there
is one. There should be a "script" and maybe "install" command. Also
look at the "services" section to see if any services need to be
running locally (e.g. mongo or rabbit).  Ignore the git-related bits
that you might find in "before_install" since they will be able git
credentials and you already have those.

If you need mongo, rabbit or redis, see the README in the [scripts
demo repository](https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/scripts) for
instructions. For example consider using the "fig.yml" with
[Fig](http://www.fig.sh/) to run them in Docker containers.

== Documentation

The spring-cloud-build module has a "docs" profile, and if you switch
that on it will try to build asciidoc sources from
`src/main/asciidoc`. As part of that process it will look for a
`README.adoc` and process it by loading all the includes, but not
parsing or rendering it, just copying it to `${main.basedir}`
(defaults to `${basedir}`, i.e. the root of the project). If there are
any changes in the README it will then show up after a Maven build as
a modified file in the correct place. Just commit it and push the change.

== Pull Requests

Spring Cloud is released under the non-restrictive Apache 2.0 license,
and follows a very standard Github development process, using Github
tracker for issues and merging pull requests into master. If you want
to contribute even something trivial please do not hesitate, but
follow the guidelines below.

=== Sign the Contributor License Agreement
Before we accept a non-trivial patch or pull request we will need you
to sign the
https://support.springsource.com/spring_committer_signup[contributor's
agreement].  Signing the contributor's agreement does not grant anyone
commit rights to the main repository, but it does mean that we can
accept your contributions, and you will get an author credit if we do.
Active contributors might be asked to join the core team, and given
the ability to merge pull requests.

=== Code Conventions and Housekeeping
None of these is essential for a pull request, but they will all help.  They can also be
added after the original pull request but before a merge.

* Use the Spring Framework code format conventions. If you use Eclipse and you follow
  the ``Importing into eclipse'' instructions below you should get project specific
  formatting automatically. You can also import formatter settings using the
  `eclipse-code-formatter.xml` file from the `eclipse` folder. If using IntelliJ, you can
  use the http://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6546[Eclipse Code Formatter Plugin]
  to import the same file.
* Make sure all new `.java` files to have a simple Javadoc class comment with at least an
  `@author` tag identifying you, and preferably at least a paragraph on what the class is
  for.
* Add the ASF license header comment to all new `.java` files (copy from existing files
  in the project)
* Add yourself as an `@author` to the .java files that you modify substantially (more
  than cosmetic changes).
* Add some Javadocs and, if you change the namespace, some XSD doc elements.
* A few unit tests would help a lot as well -- someone has to do it.
* If no-one else is using your branch, please rebase it against the current master (or
  other target branch in the main project).

=== Working with the code
If you don't have an IDE preference we would recommend that you use
http://www.springsource.com/developer/sts[Spring Tools Suite] or
http://eclipse.org[Eclipse] when working with the code. We use the
http://eclipse.org/m2e/[m2eclipe] eclipse plugin for maven support. Other IDEs and tools
should also work without issue.

=== Importing into eclipse with m2eclipse
We recommend the http://eclipse.org/m2e/[m2eclipe] eclipse plugin when working with
eclipse. If you don't already have m2eclipse installed it is available from the "eclipse
marketplace".

=== Importing into eclipse without m2eclipse
If you prefer not to use m2eclipse you can generate eclipse project metadata using the
following command:

[indent=0]
----
	$ mvn eclipse:eclipse
----

The generated eclipse projects can be imported by selecting `import existing projects`
from the `file` menu.

=== Importing into other IDEs
Maven is well supported by most Java IDEs. Refer to you vendor documentation.
