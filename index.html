{% capture billboard_description %}

Spring Cloud CLI is a set of extensions for the
[Spring Boot CLI](http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot) making it possible
to write Spring Cloud apps in Groovy scripts and run them from a
shell. Auto-imports and dependency management is provided for all
Spring Cloud projects.

## Quick Start

Any Spring Boot CLI app with the Cloud CLI extensions installed will
be a Spring Cloud Config Client, so set the `spring.cloud.config.uri`
to point to a Config Server and you are in business (defaults to
"http://localhost:8888").

Here's a complete Eureka Server:

```groovy
@EnableEurekaServer
@RestController
class Eureka {}
```

To install the CLI, make
sure you have
[Spring Boot CLI](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot)
(1.2.0 or better):

    $ spring version
    Spring CLI v1.2.1.RELEASE

E.g. for GVM users

```
$ gvm install springboot 1.2.1.RELEASE
$ gvm use springboot 1.2.1.RELEASE
```

and install the Spring Cloud plugin:

```
$ mvn install
$ spring install org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-cli:1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT
```

IMPORTANT: **Prerequisites:** to use the encryption and decryption features
you need the full-strength JCE installed in your JVM (it's not there by default).
You can download the "Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files"
from Oracle, and follow instructions for installation (essentially replace the 2 policy files
in the JRE lib/security directory with the ones that you downloaded).
