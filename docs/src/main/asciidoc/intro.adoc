Spring Boot CLI provides http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot[Spring
Boot] command line features for https://github.com/spring-cloud[Spring
Cloud]. You can write Groovy scripts to run Spring Cloud component
applications (e.g. `@EnableEurekaServer`). You can also easily do
things like encryption and decryption to support Spring Cloud Config
clients with secret configuration values. With the Launcher CLI you
can launch services like Eureka, Config Server
conveniently all at once from the command line (very useful at
development time).
